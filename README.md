# Random Forest for Credit Worthiness
This is a random forest implementation in Python, using the ID3 algorithm. It was used to build a credit score classification model for a final research project at Stony Brook University's CSE 537 Artificial Intelligence. The assignment description is as follows:

The task here is to build a Decision Tree Classifier for predicting credit worthiness of
applicants. The data set has 3 types of attribute values â€“ categorical, integers and reals.
Some attribute values are also missing. Your implementation must incorporate techniques
for addressing over fitting. The project report must include a detailed analysis of your
implementation including how well it handles over fitting, its precision and any other
performance metrics you think is important.
