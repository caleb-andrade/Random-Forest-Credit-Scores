# Random Forest for Creditworthiness
This is a random forest implementation in Python, using the ID3 algorithm. It was used to build a credit score classification model for a final research project at Stony Brook University's CSE 537 Artificial Intelligence.

## Task description
The task here is to build a Decision Tree Classifier for predicting credit worthiness of applicants. The data set has 3 types of attribute values â€“ categorical, integers and reals. Some attribute values are also missing. Your implementation must incorporate techniques for addressing over fitting. The project report must include a detailed analysis of your implementation including how well it handles over fitting, its precision and any other performance metrics you think is important.

## Using/Browsing the Code
The Forest.py file contains all the code implementation. Running the code:
    
    ./Forest.py

The readme.txt file is a description of the data attributes. The crx.data.txt is the actual data. The Decision_Tree_Report.pdf explains in more detail the code as well as the results.
